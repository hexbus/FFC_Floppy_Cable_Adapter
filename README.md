## Background:

This is a floppy drive flexible FFC cable that I had constructed to adapt older 1.25mm 26 pin FFC floppy drive connectors to newer servo-driven 1.00mm 26 pin FFC floppy drives.

Older floppy drives and connectors in laptops and other embedded equipment in the 90s used 1.25mm 26 pin FFC connectors.  Such 90s laptops as the Tandy 1100FD as well as many older Toshiba 486 laptops (and even some early Pentium 1's) used 1.25mm FFC cables and floppy drives.  The 1.25mm floppy drives were all belt driven, and the difficulty of finding belts and replacing them dictates that many people refurbishing older equipment would benefit from just swapping out the drive for a 1.00mm servo-driven floppy drive (i.e. one that doesn't need a belt).

So, I made this flexible FFC cable to allow people to use a 1.25mm laptop with a 1.00mm floppy drive.
